5. Question: The following code creates one array and one string object.
How many references to those objects exist after the code executes?
Is either object eligible for garbage collection?

...
String[] students = new String[10];
String studentName = "Peter Parker";
students[0] = studentName;
studentName = null;
...


    Answer: There is one reference to the students array and that array has one reference to the string Peter Smith.
Neither object is eligible for garbage collection.

6. Question: How does a program destroy an object that it creates?

   Answer: A program does not explicitly destroy objects.
   A program can set all references to an object to null so that it becomes eligible for garbage collection.
   But the program does not actually destroy objects.
